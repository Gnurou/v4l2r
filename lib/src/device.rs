//! Interface to the V4L2 primitives that is both safe and higher-level than
//! `ioctl`, while staying low-level enough to allow the implementation of any
//! kind of V4L2 program on top of it.
//!
//! The `Device` struct lets the user open a V4L2 device and querying its
//! capabilities, from which `Queue` objects can be created.
//!
//! A `Queue` object can be assigned a format and allocated buffers, from which
//! point it can be streamed on and off, and buffers queued to it.
//!
//! The emphasis of this interface is to limit the actions and data that are
//! accessible at a given point in time to those that make sense. For instance,
//! the compiler wil reject any code that tries to stream a queue on before it
//! has buffers allocated. Similarly, if a `Queue` uses `UserPtr` buffers, then
//! queuing a buffer requires to provide a valid memory area to back it up.
//!
//! Using this interface, the user does not have to worry about which fields of
//! a V4L2 structure make sense - if it is relevant, then it will be visible,
//! and if it is required, then the code won't compile unless it is provided.
