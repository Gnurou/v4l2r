//! Abstracts the different kinds of backing memory (`MMAP`, `USERPTR`,
//! `DMABUF`) supported by V4L2.
//!
//! V4L2 allows to use either memory that is provided by the device itself
//! (MMAP) or memory imported via user allocation (USERPTR) or the dma-buf
//! subsystem (DMABUF). This results in 2 very different behaviors and 3 memory
//! types that we need to model.
//!
//! The `Memory` trait represents these memory types and is thus implemented
//! by exacly 3 types: `MMAP`, `UserPtr`, and `DMABuf`. These types do very
//! little apart from providing a constant with the corresponding V4L2 memory
//! type they model, and implement the `SelfBacked` (for MMAP) or `Imported`
//! (for `UserPtr` and `DMABuf`) traits to indicate where their memory comes
//! from.
//!
//! The `PlaneHandle` trait is used by types which can bind to one of these
//! memory types, i.e. a type that can represent a single memory plane of a
//! buffer. For `MMAP` memory this is a void type (since `MMAP` provides its
//! own memory). `UserPtr`, a `Vec<u8>` can adequately be used as backing
//! memory, and for `DMABuf` we will use a file descriptor. For handles that
//! can be mapped into the user address-space (and indeed for `MMAP` this is
//! the only way to access the memory), the `Mappable` trait can be implemented.
//!
//! The set of handles that make all the planes for a given buffer is
//! represented by the `BufferHandles` trait. This trait is more abstract since
//! we may want to decide at runtime the kind of memory we want to use ;
//! therefore this trait does not have any particular kind of memory attached to
//! it. `PrimitiveBufferHandles` is used to represent plane handles which memory
//! type is known at compilation time, and thus includes a reference to a
//! `PlaneHandle` type and by transition its `Memory` type.
